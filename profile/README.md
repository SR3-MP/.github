SR3MP:Revamp is a new version of my original project "SR3MP" with a lot of improvements but incomplete for now.

# Features

• **F8** to open console.<br>
• **SUPPR** to unload the mod (only for debug purposes, it will not be available in the final release) (Only work on NON CEF build)<br>
• **F1** to enable/disable no clip.<br>
